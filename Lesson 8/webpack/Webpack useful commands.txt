Change config destination:
webpack --config=config/webpack.dev.js 

Build script example:
"build": "webpack --watch"

// build script builds bundle file
// if we delete bundle file and restart the server it's still gonna run based on previous bundle file 

// to create new bundle we just run *npm run build* 
// and then run server with *npm run dev-server*
