## Node.js Setup

Download Node.js: 

https://nodejs.org/en/

You will be given two options:
* LTS Recommended for most users
* Latest features

You can download any of the two versions and install it afterwards.

Once the installation process is complete, open the terminal / command line and type a
few commands to check if everything was installed correctly.

First check for Node version by typing:

``` node -v ```

My current version is v11.11.0.

Then we check for npm version by typing:

``` npm -v ```

My current version is 6.9.0.

If both of these commands work, you are done with setup and ready to start using **Node.js**.
