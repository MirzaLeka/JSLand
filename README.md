# JSLand
I started this repository to fill my gaps with JavaScript language. It all started as a *JavaScript 30 days challenge*, but as time went on I kept updating the repoistory with various kinds of technologies and decided to turn it into a library where anyone can learn something new. Read the full story on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mirza.ng4/back-to-square-one-javascript-41355ef3eda).

Introducing **JSLand**, one of the best places to learn **JavaScript**! 

JSLand project is heavily focused on JavaScript language and covers topics like object oriented programming, major features of ES2015, ES2016, all the way to ES2019, asynchronous javascript, higher order functions, context, collections, immutability, but also Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mocha, Lodash, Jquery, Webpack and React. 
There is also a section for various interesting modules like Moment, Bcrypt and many other.

In every lesson there is a __Useful links__ file where you'll find more detailed docs regarding the lesson,
as well as videos that will explain to you how things work. 

### Contributions

This repository is public and __encourages__ forking with other users to contribute to open source by helping others learn
tough topics of JavaScript.
If you want to contribute, please do. JavaScript is a huge language and there is no way I can cover everything that is needed to be known. You can update the existing lessons or create a new ones. Every line of code you write makes an __impact__.

> But please, make sure you write clean and *error-free* code.

One last important thing to say is that lessons are **not** connected. 
There is **no** start script. If you see any scripts in *package.json* file, these are not connected to one project, but rather spread across multiple lessons and used where needed.


With that out of the way, I wish you happy coding and I hope you teach all of us something new.
