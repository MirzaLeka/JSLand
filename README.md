# JavaScript30
Intermediate to Pro practice course

![](readMe_img/js-logo.jpg)

I started this repository to fill my gaps with JavaScript language, but as time went on I thought why not turn this into a library
where anyone can learn something. 
This repository is public and encourages forking with other users to contribute to open source by helping others learn
tough topics of JavaScript.

For nearly every lesson there is a *Useful links* file where you'll find more detailed docs regarding the lesson,
as well as videos that will explain to you how things work. 
I'm also adding coding challenges which can be found in Challenges directory.

### Contributions

If you'd like to contribute, please do, but please, please, please, **don't** change code in files I created. If you don't like my code
or you think I made a mistake, please write your own code in your own **file**. 
The reason why I asking you to make your own files, instead of editing the existing ones is because I initially wrote this code
to help myself learn in way I can understand it.

One last important thing to say is that lessons are **not** connected. 
There is no **start** script. If you see any scripts in *package.json* file, these are not connected to one project, but rather spread across multiple lessons and used where needed.


With that out of the way, I wish you happy coding.

### Where to next?

As you can see the list is almost complete. All lessons I intended to cover are listed above, but the list doesn't have to stop here. So I'm asking myself **where to next**?
Maybe you know some Javascript tehnology I haven't covered yet. If so, feel free the add a new lesson and code on!
I'm excited to learn new techonologies like React Native, PhaserJS, ThreeJS, GraphQL and cover them when the time is right.
