# JavaScript30
Intermediate to Pro practice course

![](readMe_img/js-logo.jpg)

I started this repository to fill my gaps with JavaScript language, but as time went on I thought why not turn this into a library
where anyone can learn something. 
This repository is public and encourages forking with other users to contribute to open source by helping others learn
tough topics of JavaScript.

If you'd like to contribute, please do, but please, please, please, **don't** change code in files I created. If you don't like my code
or you think I made a mistake, please write your own code in your own **file**. 
The reason why I asking you to make your own files, instead of editing the existing ones is because I initially wrote this code
to help myself learn in way I can understand it.
I'm also adding coding challenges which can be found in folders directory.

One last important thing to say is that lessons are not connected. 
There is no **start** script. If you see any scripts in *package.json* file, these are not connected to one project, but rather spread across multiple lessons and used where needed.

With that out of the way, I wish you happy coding moments. 
Now let's look at the topics I intend to cover in this repository.
