/* Try and Catch */

// Try and catch is used to handle runtime errors. That means code will run but it will fail at some point, like we dividing with zero
    // Parse time errors will prevent code from executing at all and will crash at start, like opening { and not closing it

// There are 4 principles of error handling
    // 1) try
    // 2) catch
    // 3) throw
    // 4) finnaly

// Example

    // try{

    //     console.log("Start of try runs");

    //     unicycle; // is not defined, thus this will fail

    //     console.log("End of try runs -- will never be executed");

    // }
